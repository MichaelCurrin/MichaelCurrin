## Hi, I am a software maker
> I am a "Data genie" and "open sourcerer"

I am a Senior Software Engineer at 2U with fullstack skills.

I love to build websites and automate tasks using the power of Python or JavaScript or another tool that is right for the job. I think Go might be the next big thing. I like to teach and learn from others both at community events and online.

### Skills 🎓

Python is my first love and preferred language - see my [Python repos on GitHub](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=python). My experience covers backend (databases, APIs), frontend (webpage design and JS), security, containers, automated tests and deployment pipelines.

### Projects 💼

If you're interested to see my showcase of some my best projects, see my Pinned Repositories a bit further down on my profile.

I like to make quickstarts which can be used as templates to make websites, such as with React, Vue, MkDocs, Jekyll or Docsify. See my [quickstart](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin?tab=repositories&q=quickstart&type=&language=) projects on GitHub.

My gists are available on a one-page site: https://michaelcurrin.github.io/gist-viewer/

### I'm currently working on 🔭 

Here are projects or ideas which I have been working on in the last few months.

- [![MichaelCurrin.github.io - Dev Resources](https://img.shields.io/badge/MichaelCurrin.github.io-Dev_Resources-2bbc8a)](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-resources/)
- Always writing and improving on [Dev Cheatsheets](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/dev-cheatsheets/) and [Code Cookbook](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/code-cookbook)
- Writing more and better blog posts
- Improving my [Badge generator](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator) project 
- Icons
     - How can I use this in my website projects? As external source but also I can download the icons I care about as a central reference https://simpleicons.org/ Add it to my cheatsheats - including color for eahc
     - Compare with GH Topic icons which are more detailed. [repo](https://github.com/github/explore/tree/master/topics)
     - Maybe make a generator which can generate both.
- Better Jekyll sites and designing websites
- Make a [Self-updating README](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/10/self-updating-profile-readme/) - based on [github.com/simonw/simonw](https://github.com/simonw/simonw)
- How can I use GitHub projects to manage my projects at a high-level or just bookmark repos and gists there? Rather than maintaining a list.

### What is this README profile thing? 🤔

<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
     
This page you are reading is a profile readme. Around July 2020, GitHub made this a public feature.

To make one, create a repo named after your username (matching case exactly) and create a `README.md` file in it. Then go to your GitHub profile and you'll see your README appear there ✨.
